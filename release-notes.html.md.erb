**Release Date:** November 17, 2020

### Features

New feature in this release:

* **Initial release:** This is the initial release for the <%= vars.product_full %> tile.

### Known Issues
* [POSTGRESQL]  Due to a limitation with AWS Postgres, instance plans cannot be changed to a smaller plan (using cf update-service -p). 
This applies to subsumed Postgres Instances as well. Updates to an instance of PostgreSQL will fail if they attempt to update `storage_gb` See [AWS Docs for more details](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/rds-db-storage-size/)
